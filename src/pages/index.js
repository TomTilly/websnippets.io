    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      websnippets.io is a free, open source, and minimalist component library
      for website UI elements. Each component is built upon the foundations of
      accessibility, simplicity, and best practices. They are available in
      vanilla form (raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and as React components. Use
      them as is or as a base for your own components.
    </p>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      There are a few ways to use a component. The easiest is to just copy and
      paste the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript straight into your projects.
      Alternatively, you can run
      <InlineCode>npm install websnippets-standard</InlineCode> in your project
      directory and link to the appropriate CSS and JS.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re working in React, run{' '}
      <InlineCode>npm install websnippets-react</InlineCode> and import
      whichever components you need. Enjoy!
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      This site was built by me (
      <a
        href="https://tomtillistrand.com"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >

      ) to share my personal component library with other web developers. The
      code is open source, which I hope leads to other developers submitting
      improvements which we can all learn and benefit from. My last goal with
      this project was to provide consistent, well-formed code for all the
      common UI elements that beginning web developers could use as reliable
      references. Many components have companion "How To" articles on my
      website.
